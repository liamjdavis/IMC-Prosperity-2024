Last year's format:

1. Round 1: Bananas and Pearls
    - Bananas have a volatile price(but relatively linear)
    - Pearls had a very stable price

2. Round 2: Coconuts and Pina Coladas
    - Coconuts are an ingredient in Pina Coladas
    - Thus price of Pina Coladas are derived from the price of Coconuts

3. Round 3: Berries and Diving Gear
    - Berries are a seasonal good
    - Diving Gear is influenced by Dolphin Sightings

4. Round 4: Picnic Baskets, Ukulele, Dip and Baguette
    - A picnic basket has one ukulele, one dip and one Baguette
    - price of picnic basket is not equivalent to the sum of the 3 goods

5. Round 5: Can use any IMC bots or previous bots


General Strat:
    1. For stable goods, derive a strike price for both buying and selling
    2. For volatile goods, develop a base momentum trading model
    3. For related goods, develop a base pair trading model

Specific Strat:
- Bananas: Use a RSI with a wider range specific to bananas (like 80 20)
